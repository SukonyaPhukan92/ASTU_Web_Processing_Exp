  <p>As the world running towards the  <b>automation</b> and <b>Internet of Things</b> are expanding around the World. Internet of Things connects the Whole world into a global village through mobile devices. The overlap between <b>cybersecurity</b> and mobility will also continue with the demands of automation. In a maximum of automated devices, sensors are used which not only track but also collect the data. These data are sent to some servers.<strong> In the forthcoming 30 years, Automation will make life as easy as falling off a log.</strong> With technology, people will be able to do their tasks at their fingertips. People will be able to instruct coffee maker to make coffee with a voice like we instruct Alexa to play a song. Engineering, working persons will be able to monitor contraction works, able to take any m measurement using the sensor from home. Companies & offices will be able to track and collect data more easily.</p>

 <p><strong>BYOD (Bring Your Own Devices) and IoT (Internet of Things)</strong> will both continue to grow as people are always looking comfortable life. As allowing BYOD in the company, there are more chances of better output as a maximum of employees comfortable with their own devices. Also, employees can complete their remaining office work from home. With the increasing demand for IoT and uses of BYOD, people can monitor any tasks from remote immediately. But, sometimes BYOD puts the organization at greater risk due to an insecure/weak control system at home. Also, there are chances of copy or stolen of corporation data.</p>

<p>To solve these problems, data security shall be stronger. The corporation has to develop some secure file management systems in which data will not be able to copy to unauthorized devices. Also, that data will be able to remove from remote, if the personal device with the corporation data gets lost. In automated devices, developed using the Internet of Things shall have more secure data management systems, so that hackers cannot access it easily.</p>

  <p><strong>In this era, the digital era or the digital age, information is considered to be an economic resource,</strong> a key factor in the concept of evolution, it is an essential tool for the success or the failure at the individual, organization, societal, national and international level. Therefore, data or information security has become a very important issue and a growing concept that affects all sectors without the slightest exception.</p>

 <p>In simpler words, the importance of <b>data security</b> nowadays is as crucial as the amount, content and sometimes confidentiality of the information put out there.</p>

<p><b>Cybersecurity</b> has simultaneously evolved with the way businesses and structures work.</p>

<p>Nowadays, pretty much everything is displayed on the internet: from social media to online banking to digital hospital records, every piece of our lives is available on the internet. Hackers and other nefarious characters can fight to gain access to this information and use it for their purposes. In essence, everyone needs cybersecurity. Because just about everyone has personal information available via the internet. </p>

<p>The scale and sophistication of <b>cyber-attacks/breaches</b> are intensifying. Firms cannot afford to sit back and take the importance of cybersecurity lightly. As firms now remain reliant on an online ecosystem to conduct business, they must realize their websites, portals, apps, and digital communications could be easily be targeted and exposed to cyber-attacks and breaches if they are not up-to-date with the cybersecurity practices and procedures. So key decision-makers need to put an urgent spotlight on cybersecurity by placing it high on their agenda. This includes investing a sufficient amount of money to ensure their IT estate has the capabilities to consistently get basic defenses right and establishing adequate governance on cybersecurity for employees to thoroughly follow.</p>

  <h1>Roles of the Cybersecurity Professional and its impact on the Organization?</h1>
  <p>
    At a mile-high level, <b>Cybersecurity professionals</b> are responsible for protecting IT infrastructure, edge devices, networks, and data. More granularly, they are responsible for preventing <b>data breaches</b> and monitoring and reacting to attacks. Many have backgrounds as programmers, and systems or network administrators, and in math and statistics. Those skills are undoubtedly relevant to the role of an IT security professional, but equally as critical are the things that aren’t necessarily things that can be taught – critical thinking, curiosity, and a passion for learning and research. People from all kinds of backgrounds possess those qualities, so companies shouldn’t limit themselves to a narrow pool of candidates. Further, hackers are creative by nature. To outsmart them, security pros need to be, as well.
    <p>

  <p> <b>Cybersecurity professionals</b>  are most often considered to serve in a management capacity.  The important tasks of developing <b>security</b> regulations, training staff, and monitoring implementation require that the security manager be vested with substantial authority.  While the security manager is not to be confused with a superintendent or principal, he or she should be considered to be the system "boss."  If the security manager is not able to confidently address security miscues at even the highest levels of the organizational hierarchy, protecting system resources adequately becomes an impossibility.
